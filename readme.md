## Installation

Follow these steps to set up SMDB locally:

### Prerequisites
- **Web Server**: Apache, Nginx, or any server supporting PHP (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
- **MySQL**: A MySQL server to host the database.
- **Node.js**: Optional, for local development or additional tooling.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smdb.git
   cd smdb
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Import the `smdb.sql` file into your MySQL server to create the `SMDB` database and populate the `entries` table:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p SMDB < smdb.sql
     ```
   - Ensure the database uses `utf8mb4` encoding with `utf8mb4_hungarian_ci` collation.

3. **Configure the Backend**:
   - Update `connect.php` with your MySQL credentials if different from the defaults:
     ```php
     $servername = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $dbname = "SMDB";
     ```
   - Place the PHP files (`connect.php`, `smdb.php`, `topactors.php`) in your server's root directory (e.g., `/htdocs` for XAMPP).

4. **Host the Frontend**:
   - Copy the frontend files (`index.html`, `preloader.html`, `app.js`, `MainController.js`, `PreloaderController.js`, and any CSS/JS assets) to your server's public directory.
   - Ensure the AngularJS and Font Awesome CDNs are accessible or host them locally.

5. **Start the Server**:
   - Start your web server (e.g., Apache via XAMPP).
   - Ensure the MySQL server is running.

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/SMDB` (adjust the path based on your server setup).

   - Upon loading, SMDB fetches all movies and series from the backend API.
   - View the total count of movies, series, and favorites at the top.
   - Explore top genres and featured actors with their respective statistics.

2. **Filter and Search**:
   - Use the dropdown to switch between Movies and Series.
   - Enter a title or director name in the search inputs to filter results.

   - Toggle the sort order (ascending/descending) using the arrow button.

4. **Manage Favorites**:
   - Click the heart icon next to an entry to add/remove it from your favorites.
   - Favorites are saved to localStorage and persist across sessions.

5. **Interact with the UI**:
   - Enjoy the preloader animation on page load, which fades out after 3 seconds.
   - Move your mouse to see the custom cursor with trailing dots.
   - Scroll down the page to reveal the "Scroll to Top" button for quick navigation.

The database (`SMDB`) contains a single table, `entries`, with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE entries (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  img VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,           -- Poster image URL
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- Movie/Series title
  director VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,      -- Director's name

   - **Response**: JSON array of all entries from the `entries` table.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "img": "alien.jpg",
         "title": "Alien",
         "director": "Ridley Scott",
         ...
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```

2. **`topactors.php`**:
   - **URL**: `http://localhost/SMDB/backend/api/topactors.php`
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Response**: JSON array of the top 3 actors with their movie counts and percentage share.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "name": "Tom Hardy",
         "moviesCount": 5,
         "percent": 4
